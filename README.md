## Description

This project was made so the user can easily create a simple page populated with his/her team members. This is done in the terminal by asking the user a series of questions regarding the team, and will create cards which display the team's information. This was done using node.js and object oriented programming (OOP). Classes were created and can be reused with new information as many times as needed. This project helped me get comfortable with OOP and the use of classes, prototypes, extending children classes based on ther parent class, and using node.js libraries.

## Installation

The first step would be to clone this repo, as well as downloading node.js. Once thats done the user will need to install the libraries used in the application by running the command npm install. Lastly, the user will need to run the application itself using the command node index.js.

## Usage
